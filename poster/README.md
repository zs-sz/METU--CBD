create a series of posters based on the "pantone color of the year" dataset (data.json)

- Use the processing template and code (based on template).


## Pure Design (The art director approach)
- Design a concept (with examples) that uses algorytmic ideas that contains enough information for programmatic execution (in plain english: "I dont know how to code but I know its available and an other department can execute it based on your concept").

## Send Format
- .pde (processing)
- .pdf
- dimensions are NOT restricted but should be the same for all items in a collection
